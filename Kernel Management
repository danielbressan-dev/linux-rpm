> Hardware Inicialization Process

1° Kernel probes hardware;
2° systemd-udevd loads required drivers;
3° udevd reads rules files in /usr/lib/udev/rules.d (do not change this files);
4° udevd reads custom rules in /etc/udev/rules.d ;
5° kernel modules are loaded and status about kernel and hardware are written to the sysfs file system, mounted /sys . which is a kind of pseudo file system

/proc :kernel interface that provides access to kernel information and kernel tunables. contains files with detail status information about what is happening on your server
/sys :sysfs, the kernel interface directory and which is used to provide access to parameters that can be used for managing hardware settings.

* Overview Commands *

$ ps aux :shows kernel threads.
$ dmesg :shows contents of the kernel ring buffer, where linux kernel keeps its recents log messages.
$ journalctl --dmesg :same as above but with different format.
$ jounal ctl -K :same as above but with different format.
$ uname -a :overview of relevant parameters
$ uname -r :show which kernel version is in use
$ hostnamectl :shows information about kernel
$ cat /etc/redhat-release :shows kernel version
$ udevadm monitor :real time scannig to see plugged and unplugged devices

* Managing Kernel Module Commands *

$ lsmod :list currently loaded kernel modules.
$ modinfo <module-name> :displays information about kernel modules.
$ modprobe <module-name> :loads kernel module, including their dependencies. 
$ modprobe -r <module-name> :unloads kernel module, considering their dependencies.
$ lspci :shows all hardware devices that have been detected on the pci bus.
$ lspci -k :list al kernel modules that are used for the pci devices that were detected

* Load Modules with specific parameters *

# create a .conf file at /etc/modprobe.d
