> Hardware Inicialization Process

1° Kernel probes hardware;
2° systemd-udevd loads required drivers;
3° udevd reads rules files in /usr/lib/udev/rules.d (do not change this files);
4° udevd reads custom rules in /etc/udev/rules.d ;
5° kernel modules are loaded and status about kernel and hardware are written to the sysfs file system, mounted /sys . which is a kind of pseudo file system
