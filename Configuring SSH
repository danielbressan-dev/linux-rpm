obs: after any important change in configurations files, Firewall, port change in Selinux should be followed by a Systemctl restart commnand.

$ firewall-cmd --reload
$ systemctl restart sshd
$ systemctl daemon-reload
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* Commands *

$ ssh <user>@<ip-address> :connect to host.
$ ssh-keygen :generates authentication key pair.
$ ssh-copy-id <server2> :copy public key to the server that you want to connect.

$ ssh-agent /bin/bash :start agent to cache the created ssh passphrase for current (Bash) shell.
$ ssh-add :add the passphrase for the current user's private key.

$ semanage port -l :list ports and labels.
$ semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp <port-number> :label port. more info $man semanage port
$ semanage port -m :modify the current port assign.

$ firewall-cmd --add-port=<port-number>/tcp
$ firewall-cmd --add-port=<port-number>/tcp --permanent

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* Config files/directories *

~/.ssh/known_hosts :file where public key fingerprint is stored.
~/.ssh/id_rsa :generated after $ssh-keygen. where the private key is stored.
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub :generated after $ssh-keygen. where the public key is stored.
/home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys :where public keys are stored to allow other servers to connect in.

/etc/ssh/ssh_config :general configuration file.
/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d :where custom configurations can be made.
/etc/hosts :DNS name resolution (not enough to connect with internet).

/var/log/secure :where AUTHPRIV syslog facility writes, and ssh failed logs are included.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* Measures to protect SSH servers *

# after any modification $systemctl restart sshd
# ssh writes log information about failed login attempts to the AUTHPRIV syslog facility. By default this facility writes on /var/log/secure

- Disable password login: generate public/private key pair with $ssh-keygen and copy to client through $ssh-copy-id <user>@<server>

- Disable root login: modify "PermitRootLogin" parameter in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

- Configure a nondefault port for SSH to listen on: 
  1) SELinux labels port for security, so you need label the new assigned port
     $ semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp <port-number> :label port. more info $man semanage port
  2) create <file>.conf under /etc/ssh/sshd.config.d/ or modify parameter in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  3) open firewall for new port using two commands in a roll:
     $ firewall-cmd --add-port=<port-number>/tcp
     $ firewall-cmd --add-port=<port-number>/tcp --permanent

- Allow only specific users to log in with SSH: 
   1) add the "AllowUsers" (it is not there by default) option under /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/<file>.conf or /etc/ssh/sshd_config

* Sessions Options *

- Port :Defines the TCP listening port.
- PermitRootLogin :Indicates whether to allow or disallow root login.
- MaxAuthTries :Specifies the maximum number of authentication tries. After reaching half of this number, failures are logged to syslog.
- MaxSessions :Indicates the maximum number of sessions that can be open from one IP address.
- AllowUsers :Specifies a space-separated list of users who are allowed to connect to the server.
- PasswordAuthentication :Specifies whether to allow password authentication. This option is on by default.
- GSSAPIAuthentication :Indicates whether authentication through the GSSAPI needs to be enabled. Used for Kerberos-based authentication.
- TCPKeepAlive :Specifies whether or not to clean up inactive TCP connections.
- ClientAliveInterval :Specifies the interval, in seconds, that packets are sent to the client to figure out if the client is still alive.
- ClientAliveCountMax :Specifies the number of client alive packets that need to be sent.
- UseDNS :If on, uses DNS name lookup to match incoming IP addresses to names.
- ServerAliveInterval :Specifies the interval, in seconds, that a client sends a packet to a server to keep connections alive.
- ServerAliveCountMax :Specifies the maximum number of packets a client sends to a server to keep connections alive.
